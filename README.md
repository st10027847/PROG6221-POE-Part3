# POE-Part3

When you have downloaded all of the necessary files and code sources, which can be found 
on my GitHub Repository (Prog6221-POE-Part3) Link:https://github.com/st10027847/PROG6221-POE-Part3, you will need to open the files in an IDE 
(Integrated Development Environment), preferably Microsoft Visual Studio. 

Once you have opened the application in the editor, you may find that the editor will not 
automatically open the main source code files. If this happens, follow these steps:

  1. Open the solution explorer by clicking on view → Solution Explorer
  2. Once you have opened Solution Explorer, click on the arrow on the left of the option 
     called ‘MainWindow.xaml’. Once you have clicked on the arrow, you should see 
     another item appear which is called ‘MainWindow.xaml.cs’. You will need to open 
     both the xaml and xaml.cs files by double-clicking on each of them.
  3. Once they are opened, you should see Three tabs open; Solution Explorer, 
     MainWindow.xaml, and MainWindow.xaml.cs
  4. Now that all of the necessary tabs are open, you should see a green button at the top 
     of your screen which says Start. Press this button and the program should start 
     running.
  5. Once the program has started up, you should see a window appear.
